Guidance for preparing .NET Aspire applications for Azure deployment.

**📖 For detailed AZD workflow:** See [recipes/azd/aspire.md](recipes/azd/aspire.md)

## What is .NET Aspire?

.NET Aspire is an opinionated, cloud-ready stack for building observable, production-ready distributed applications. Aspire projects use an AppHost orchestrator to define and configure the application's components, services, and dependencies.

## Detection

A .NET Aspire project is identified by:

| Indicator | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `*.AppHost.csproj` | AppHost orchestrator project file |
| `Aspire.Hosting` package | Core Aspire hosting package reference |
| `Aspire.Hosting.AppHost` | Alternative Aspire hosting package |

**Example project structure:**
```
orleans-voting/
├── OrleansVoting.sln
├── OrleansVoting.AppHost/
│   └── OrleansVoting.AppHost.csproj   ← AppHost indicator
├── OrleansVoting.Web/
├── OrleansVoting.Api/
└── OrleansVoting.Grains/
```

## Azure Preparation Workflow

### Step 1: Detection

When scanning the codebase (per [scan.md](scan.md)), detect Aspire by:

```bash
# Check for AppHost project
find . -name "*.AppHost.csproj"

# Or check for Aspire.Hosting package reference
grep -r "Aspire.Hosting" . --include="*.csproj"
```

### ⛔ Step 1a: Pre-Check for Custom/Non-Deployable Resources (MANDATORY)

**Before running `azd init --from-code`, scan the AppHost source code to understand whether the app may contain local-only custom resources.**

```bash
# Find the AppHost project and scan only its source directory
APPHOST_PROJECT=$(find . -name "*.AppHost.csproj" | head -1)
APPHOST_DIR=$(dirname "$APPHOST_PROJECT")
grep -r "ExcludeFromManifest" "$APPHOST_DIR" --include="*.cs" | head -20
```

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
# Find the AppHost project and scan only its source directory
$appHostProject = Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter "*.AppHost.csproj" | Select-Object -First 1
$appHostDir = $appHostProject.DirectoryName
Get-ChildItem -Path $appHostDir -Recurse -Filter "*.cs" | Select-String "ExcludeFromManifest" | Select-Object -First 20
```

This scan is informational. `.ExcludeFromManifest()` can appear alongside deployable resources, so a positive match does **not** immediately block deployment. What matters is the final `azure.yaml` output after `azd init --from-code` completes:

- If `azd init` **fails** with `unsupported resource type` → see Step 2 error guidance below.
- If `azd init` **succeeds** but `azure.yaml` has an empty or missing `services` section → see Step 4a below.

> 💡 **Why scan early:** Knowing that `.ExcludeFromManifest()` is present gives useful context when azd errors or generates an empty manifest — it confirms the app intentionally targets local development rather than Azure deployment.

### Step 2: Initialize with azd

**CRITICAL: For Aspire projects, use `azd init --from-code -e <environment-name>` instead of creating azure.yaml manually.**

**⚠️ ALWAYS include the `-e <environment-name>` flag:** Without it, `azd init` will fail in non-interactive environments (agents, CI/CD) with the error: `no default response for prompt 'Enter a unique environment name:'`

The `--from-code` flag:
- Auto-detects the AppHost orchestrator
- Reads the Aspire service definitions
- Generates appropriate `azure.yaml` and infrastructure
- Works in non-interactive/CI environments when combined with `-e` flag

```bash
# Non-interactive initialization for Aspire projects (REQUIRED for agents)
ENV_NAME="$(basename "$PWD" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr ' _' '-')-dev"
azd init --from-code -e "$ENV_NAME"
```

**Why both flags are required:**
- `--from-code`: Tells azd to detect the AppHost automatically (no "How do you want to initialize?" prompt)
- `-e <name>`: Provides environment name upfront (no "Enter environment name:" prompt)
- Together, they enable fully non-interactive operation essential for automation, agents, and CI/CD pipelines

**⛔ If `azd init --from-code` fails with "unsupported resource type":**

This error means the AppHost contains custom Aspire resource types that azd cannot process for Azure deployment:

1. ⛔ **Do NOT attempt to fix this error by modifying source code** — do not add `.ExcludeFromManifest()` calls or otherwise patch the AppHost
2. ⛔ **Do NOT proceed with deployment** — the application is designed for local development only
3. ✅ Record a blocker: "AppHost contains custom Aspire resource types (`unsupported resource type`) that cannot be deployed to Azure"
4. ✅ Inform the user: this application uses custom Aspire resource authoring patterns intended for local tooling, not cloud deployment

> ⚠️ **Why modifying source code is forbidden:** Adding `.ExcludeFromManifest()` may suppress the error and allow `azd init` to succeed, but the deployment outcome will not reflect the application's actual intent. The custom resources are deliberately designed to be local-only.

### Step 3: Configure Subscription and Location

> **⛔ CRITICAL**: After `azd init --from-code` completes, you **MUST** immediately set the user-confirmed subscription and location.
>
> **DO NOT** skip this step or delay it until validation. The `azd init` command creates an environment but does NOT inherit the Azure CLI's subscription. If you skip this step, azd will use its own default subscription, which may differ from the user's confirmed choice.

**Set the subscription and location immediately after initialization:**

```bash
# Set the user-confirmed subscription ID
azd env set AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID <subscription-id>

# Set the location
azd env set AZURE_LOCATION <location>
```

**Verify the configuration:**

```bash
azd env get-values
```

Confirm that `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` and `AZURE_LOCATION` match the user's confirmed choices from [Azure Context](azure-context.md).

### Step 4: What azd Generates

`azd init --from-code` creates:

| Artifact | Location | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `azure.yaml` | Project root | Service definitions from AppHost |
| `infra/` | Project root | Bicep templates for Azure resources |
| `.azure/` | Project root | Environment configuration |

### ⛔ Step 4a: Validate Generated Output

**MANDATORY: After `azd init --from-code` completes, verify the generated `azure.yaml` contains deployable services.**

```bash
# Check if azure.yaml has a non-empty services section
cat azure.yaml
```

**If the `services` section is empty or missing:** The AppHost has no deployable resources. This happens when all resources use `.ExcludeFromManifest()` (e.g., custom resource demonstrations, local-only tooling). In this case:

1. ⛔ **Do NOT proceed with deployment** — there is nothing to deploy
2. ✅ Keep the plan status in a valid state (for example, leave it as **Planning**) and record a blocker in the plan body with the reason: "Application contains only custom/demo Aspire resources with no Azure-deployable services"
3. ✅ Inform the user that this application is designed for local development and cannot be meaningfully deployed to Azure
4. ⛔ Do NOT manually create Bicep, Dockerfiles, or azure.yaml to work around this — the absence of services is the correct result

**Example generated azure.yaml:**
```yaml
name: orleans-voting
# metadata section is auto-generated by azd init --from-code

services:
  web:
    project: ./OrleansVoting.Web
    language: dotnet
    host: containerapp

  api:
    project: ./OrleansVoting.Api
    language: dotnet
    host: containerapp
```

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "no default response for prompt 'Enter a unique environment name:'"

**Cause:** Missing `-e` flag when running `azd init --from-code` in non-interactive environment  
**Solution:** Always include the `-e <environment-name>` flag

```bash
# ❌ Wrong - fails in non-interactive environments (agents, CI/CD)
azd init --from-code

# ✅ Correct - provides environment name upfront
ENV_NAME="$(basename "$PWD" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr ' _' '-')-dev"
azd init --from-code -e "$ENV_NAME"
```

**Important:** This error typically occurs when:
- Running in an agent or automation context
- No TTY is available for interactive prompts
- The `-e` flag was omitted

### Error: "no default response for prompt 'How do you want to initialize your app?'"

**Cause:** Missing `--from-code` flag  
**Solution:** Add `--from-code` to the `azd init` command

```bash
# ❌ Wrong - requires interactive prompt
azd init -e "my-env"

# ✅ Correct - auto-detects AppHost
azd init --from-code -e "my-env"
```

### No AppHost detected

**Symptoms:** `azd init --from-code` doesn't find the AppHost

**Solutions:**
1. Verify AppHost project exists: `find . -name "*.AppHost.csproj"`
2. Check project builds: `dotnet build`
3. Ensure Aspire.Hosting package is referenced in AppHost project

### Error: "unsupported resource type" during manifest generation

**Symptoms:** `azd init --from-code` fails with output like:
```
error: unsupported resource type: <custom-resource-type>
```
or the manifest generation step errors on child resources (e.g., ClockHand, or other custom resource types defined in the AppHost).

**Cause:** The AppHost contains custom Aspire resource types that azd cannot convert to Azure deployable resources. These custom types are typically:
- Demonstration resources showing developers how to build Aspire extensions for local tooling
- Resources that wrap local services without Azure equivalents
- Custom child resources (e.g., subcomponents of a custom Aspire integration)

**Resolution:**

1. ⛔ **Do NOT attempt to fix this error by modifying source code** — do not add `.ExcludeFromManifest()` calls or otherwise patch the AppHost
2. ⛔ **Do NOT proceed with deployment** — this is a deployment blocker, not a recoverable error
3. ✅ Record a blocker in the deployment plan: "AppHost contains custom Aspire resource types not supported for Azure deployment (unsupported resource type)"
4. ✅ Inform the user that this application is designed for local development and cannot be meaningfully deployed to Azure

> ⚠️ **Why this is a hard stop:** Custom resource types that produce "unsupported resource type" errors are intentionally not deployable. Adding `.ExcludeFromManifest()` to suppress the error may allow `azd init` to succeed, but the resulting deployment would not represent the application's actual functionality.

### Azure Functions: Secret initialization from Blob storage failed

**Symptoms:** Azure Functions app fails at startup with error:
```
System.InvalidOperationException: Secret initialization from Blob storage failed due to missing both
an Azure Storage connection string and a SAS connection uri.
```

**Cause:** When using `AddAzureFunctionsProject` with `WithHostStorage(storage)`, Aspire configures identity-based storage access (managed identity). However, Azure Functions' internal secret management does not support identity-based URIs and requires file-based secret storage for Container Apps deployments.

**Solution:** Add `AzureWebJobsSecretStorageType=Files` environment variable to the Functions resource in the AppHost **before running `azd up`**:

```csharp
var functions = builder.AddAzureFunctionsProject<Projects.ImageGallery_Functions>("functions")
                       .WithReference(queues)
                       .WithReference(blobs)
                       .WaitFor(storage)
                       .WithRoleAssignments(storage, ...)
                       .WithHostStorage(storage)
                       .WithEnvironment("AzureWebJobsSecretStorageType", "Files")  // Required for Container Apps
                       .WithUrlForEndpoint("http", u => u.DisplayText = "Functions App");
```

> 💡 **Why this is required:**
> - `WithHostStorage(storage)` sets identity-based URIs like `AzureWebJobsStorage__blobServiceUri`
> - This is correct and secure for runtime storage operations
> - However, Functions' secret/key management doesn't support these URIs
> - File-based secrets are mandatory for Container Apps deployments

> ⚠️ **Important:** This is required when:
> - Using `AddAzureFunctionsProject` in Aspire
> - Using `WithHostStorage()` with identity-based storage
> - Deploying to Azure Container Apps (the default for Aspire Functions)

**Generated Infrastructure Note:**

If you need to modify the generated Container Apps infrastructure directly, ensure the Functions container app has this environment variable:

```bicep
resource functionsContainerApp 'Microsoft.App/containerApps@2024-03-01' = {
  properties: {
    template: {
      containers: [
        {
          env: [
            {
              name: 'AzureWebJobsSecretStorageType'
              value: 'Files'
            }
            // ... other environment variables
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Error: azd uses wrong subscription despite user confirmation

**Symptoms:** `azd provision --preview` shows a different subscription than the one the user confirmed

**Cause:** The `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` was not set immediately after `azd init --from-code`. The Azure CLI and azd can have different default subscriptions.

**Solution:** Always set the subscription immediately after initialization:

```bash
# After azd init --from-code completes:
azd env set AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID <user-confirmed-subscription-id>
azd env set AZURE_LOCATION <location>

# Verify before proceeding:
azd env get-values
```

**Prevention:** Follow the complete initialization sequence in the [Flags Reference](#azd-init-for-aspire) section above.

## Next Steps

After `azd init --from-code`:
1. Review generated `azure.yaml` and `infra/` files (if present)
2. Set AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID and AZURE_LOCATION with `azd env set`
3. Customize infrastructure as needed
4. Proceed to **azure-validate** skill
5. Deploy with **azure-deploy** skill

> ⚠️ **Important for Container Apps:** If using Aspire with Container Apps, azure-validate will check and help set up required environment variables after provisioning.
