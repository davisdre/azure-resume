# Azure Enterprise Infra Planner

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when user wants to:
- Plan enterprise Azure infrastructure from a workload or architecture description
- Architect a landing zone, hub-spoke network, or multi-region topology
- Design networking infrastructure: VNets, subnets, firewalls, private endpoints, VPN gateways
- Plan identity, RBAC, and compliance-driven infrastructure
- Generate Bicep or Terraform for subscription-scope or multi-resource-group deployments
- Plan disaster recovery, failover, or cross-region high-availability topologies

## Quick Reference

| Property | Details |
|---|---|
| MCP tools | `get_azure_bestpractices_get`, `wellarchitectedframework_serviceguide_get`, `microsoft_docs_fetch`, `microsoft_docs_search`, `bicepschema_get` |
| CLI commands | `az deployment group create`, `az bicep build`, `az resource list`, `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, `terraform validate`, `terraform apply` |
| Output schema | [plan-schema.md](references/plan-schema.md) |
| Key references | [research.md](references/research.md), [resources/](references/resources/README.md), [waf-checklist.md](references/waf-checklist.md), [constraints/](references/constraints/README.md) |

## Workflow

Read [workflow.md](references/workflow.md) for detailed step-by-step instructions, including MCP tool usage, CLI commands, and decision points. Follow the phases in order, ensuring all key gates are passed before proceeding to the next phase.

| Phase | Action | Key Gate |
|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Research — WAF Tools | All MCP tool calls complete |
| 2 | Research — Refine & Lookup | Resource list approved by user |
| 3 | Plan Generation | Plan JSON written to disk |
| 4 | Verification | All checks pass, user approves |
| 5 | IaC Generation | `meta.status` = `approved` |
| 6 | Deployment | User confirms destructive actions |

## MCP Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `get_azure_bestpractices_get` | Azure best practices for code generation, operations, and deployment |
| `wellarchitectedframework_serviceguide_get` | WAF service guide for a specific Azure service |
| `microsoft_docs_search` | Search Microsoft Learn for relevant documentation chunks |
| `microsoft_docs_fetch` | Fetch full content of a Microsoft Learn page by URL |
| `bicepschema_get` | Bicep schema definition for any Azure resource type (latest API version) |

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| MCP tool error or not available | Tool call timeout, connection error, or tool doesn't exist | Retry once; fall back to reference files and notify user if unresolved |
| Plan approval missing | `meta.status` is not `approved` | Stop and prompt user for approval before IaC generation or deployment |
| IaC validation failure | `az bicep build` or `terraform validate` returns errors | Fix the generated code and re-validate; notify user if unresolved |
| Pairing constraint violation | Incompatible SKU or resource combination | Fix in plan before proceeding to IaC generation |
| Infra plan or IaC files not found | Files written to wrong location or not created | Verify files exist at `<project-root>/.azure/` and `<project-root>/infra/`; if missing, re-create the files by following [workflow.md](references/workflow.md) exactly |
