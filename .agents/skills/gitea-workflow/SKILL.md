# Gitea Workflow Orchestrator

A skill that guides agents through structured agile development workflows for Gitea repositories by intelligently invoking commands in sequence. Uses checkpoint-based flow control to auto-progress between steps while pausing at key decision points.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Working with a Gitea-hosted repository
- Starting work for the day ("run morning standup", "start my day")
- Working on a task ("implement next task", "continue working")
- Completing a development cycle ("finish this task", "prepare PR")
- Running sprint ceremonies ("start sprint", "end sprint", "retrospective")
- Resuming interrupted work ("what's next", "where was I")

Do NOT use this skill when:
- Working with GitHub repositories (use agile-workflow instead)
- Running a single specific command (use that command directly)
- Just checking status (use `/status` directly)
- Only doing code review without full cycle (use `/review-code` directly)
- Researching or planning without implementation

## Prerequisites

Before using this skill:
- **Git repository** initialized with worktree support
- **Gitea Tea CLI** installed and authenticated (`tea login`)
- **Context network** with backlog structure at `context-network/backlog/`
- Task status files at `context-network/backlog/by-status/*.md`
- **GITEA_URL** environment variable set (or configured in tea)
- **GITEA_TOKEN** environment variable set for API scripts

## State Detection

The skill determines current workflow state automatically. No manual tracking needed.

### Detection Signals

| Signal | How to Check | Indicates |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Worktree exists | `git worktree list` | Task in progress |
| Task branch active | `git branch --show-current` matches `task/*` | Active implementation |
| Uncommitted changes | `git status --porcelain` | Active coding |
| PR exists | `tea pulls list --state open` | In review |
| PR merged | `tea pulls` + check state | Ready for cleanup |

### State Matrix

```
STATE DETECTION LOGIC
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Check                           → State           → Next Step
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
No worktree, no in-progress     → IDLE            → sync, next
Worktree exists, uncommitted    → IMPLEMENTING    → continue implement
Worktree exists, all committed  → READY_REVIEW    → review-code
PR open, CI pending             → AWAITING_CI     → wait or address
PR open, CI pass                → READY_MERGE     → pr-complete
PR merged, worktree exists      → CLEANUP         → pr-complete
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

For detailed detection algorithms, see [references/state-detection.md](references/state-detection.md).

## Invocation Patterns

```bash
# Auto-detect state and continue from where you are
/gitea-workflow

# Start specific workflow phase
/gitea-workflow --phase task-cycle
/gitea-workflow --phase daily-morning
/gitea-workflow --phase daily-evening
/gitea-workflow --phase sprint-start
/gitea-workflow --phase sprint-end

# Resume work on specific task
/gitea-workflow --task TASK-123

# Preview what would happen without executing
/gitea-workflow --dry-run
```

## Task Cycle Phase

The primary workflow for completing a single task from selection to merge.

### Step 1: Sync Reality

Ensure context network matches actual project state.

```
Run: sync --last 1d --dry-run
Purpose: Detect drift between documented and actual state
Output: Sync report showing completions, partial work, divergences
```

### Step 2: Select Task

Identify the next task to work on.

```
Run: next
Purpose: Find highest priority ready task
Output: Task ID, title, branch name suggestion
```

**CHECKPOINT: TASK_SELECTED**
- Pause to confirm task selection
- User can accept or choose different task
- On accept: continue to implementation

### Step 3: Implement

Test-driven development in isolated worktree.

```
Run: implement [TASK-ID]
Purpose: Create worktree, write tests first, implement, verify
Output: Working implementation with passing tests
```

**CHECKPOINT: IMPL_COMPLETE**
- Pause after implementation completes
- Show test results and coverage
- On success: continue to review

### Step 4: Review

Quality validation of implementation.

```
Run: review-code --uncommitted
Run: review-tests --uncommitted
Purpose: Identify quality issues, security concerns, test gaps
Output: Review reports with issues and recommendations
```

**CHECKPOINT: REVIEWS_DONE**
- Display combined review results
- If critical issues: must address before continuing
- If no issues: auto-continue to PR prep
- User decides: apply recommendations now or defer

### Step 5: Apply Recommendations (Conditional)

Address review findings intelligently.

```
Run: apply-recommendations [review-output]
Purpose: Apply quick fixes now, defer complex changes to tasks
Output: Applied fixes + created follow-up tasks
```

### Step 6: Prepare PR

Create pull request with full documentation.

```
Run: pr-prep
Purpose: Validate, document, and create PR
Output: PR created with description, tests verified
```

**CHECKPOINT: PR_CREATED**
- Display PR URL and CI status
- Wait for CI checks to complete (verify manually or via API script)
- On CI pass + approval: continue to merge
- On CI fail: stop, address issues

### Step 7: Complete PR

Merge and cleanup.

```
Run: pr-complete [PR-NUMBER]
Purpose: Merge PR, delete branch, remove worktree, update status
Output: Task marked complete, cleanup done
```

### Step 8: Update Backlog and Project Status

Persist progress to source-of-truth documentation.

```
Run: Part of pr-complete (Phase 6)
Purpose: Update epic file (task → complete), unblock dependents, update project status
Output: Backlog and project status reflect actual progress
```

**Why this step matters:** Without it, completed tasks remain marked "ready" in backlog files and project status stays stale. Internal tracking files are session-scoped; the backlog and status files are the persistent source of truth.

For detailed task-cycle instructions, see [references/phases/task-cycle.md](references/phases/task-cycle.md).

## Daily Phase

Quick sequences for start and end of workday.

### Morning Standup (~5 min)

```
Run sequence:
1. sync --last 1d --dry-run   # What actually happened yesterday
2. status --brief --sprint    # Current sprint health
3. groom --ready-only         # What's ready to work on

Output: Clear picture of today's priorities
```

### Evening Wrap-up (~10 min)

```
Run sequence:
1. checklist                  # Ensure nothing lost
2. discovery                  # Capture learnings
3. sync --last 1d            # Update task statuses

Output: Knowledge preserved, state synchronized
```

For detailed daily instructions, see [references/phases/daily.md](references/phases/daily.md).

## Sprint Phase

Ceremonies for sprint boundaries.

### Sprint Start (~60 min)

```
Run sequence:
1. sync --all                 # Full reality alignment
2. groom --all               # Comprehensive grooming
3. plan sprint-goals         # Architecture and goals
4. status --detailed         # Baseline metrics

Output: Sprint plan with groomed, ready backlog
```

### Sprint End (~90 min)

```
Run sequence:
1. sync --sprint             # Final sprint sync
2. retrospective             # Capture learnings
3. audit --scope sprint      # Quality review
4. status --metrics          # Sprint metrics
5. maintenance --deep        # Context network cleanup

Output: Sprint closed, learnings captured, ready for next
```

For detailed sprint instructions, see [references/phases/sprint.md](references/phases/sprint.md).

## Checkpoint Handling

Checkpoints are pauses for human decision-making.

### Checkpoint Behavior

At each checkpoint:
1. **Summarize** what just completed
2. **Show** key results and any issues
3. **Present** next steps
4. **Wait** for user input

### Checkpoint Responses

| Response | Action |
|----------|--------|
| "continue" / "proceed" / "yes" | Move to next step |
| "stop" / "pause" | Save state, exit workflow |
| "back" | Re-run previous step |
| "skip" | Skip current step (use cautiously) |
| Custom input | May adjust next step parameters |

### Auto-Continue Conditions

Some checkpoints can auto-continue when conditions are met:

| Checkpoint | Auto-Continue If |
|------------|------------------|
| IMPL_COMPLETE | All tests pass, build succeeds |
| REVIEWS_DONE | No critical or high severity issues |
| PR_CREATED | CI passes (verified via API), required approvals obtained |

For detailed checkpoint handling, see [references/checkpoint-handling.md](references/checkpoint-handling.md).

## Command Reference

## Gitea-Specific Notes

### CI Status Checking

Gitea uses external CI systems (Drone, Woodpecker, Jenkins, etc.). To check CI status:

1. **Via API Script**: Use `scripts/gitea-ci-status.sh` to query commit statuses
2. **Manual Verification**: Check your CI dashboard directly
3. **PR Mergeability**: Check if PR shows as mergeable in Gitea UI

### Tea CLI Command Reference

| Operation | Tea CLI Command |
|-----------|-----------------|
| List open PRs | `tea pulls list --state open` |
| Create PR | `tea pulls create --title "..." --description "..." --base main --head branch` |
| View PR | `tea pulls` |
| Merge PR (squash) | `tea pulls merge --style squash` |
| Merge PR (merge) | `tea pulls merge --style merge` |
| Merge PR (rebase) | `tea pulls merge --style rebase` |
| Approve PR | `tea pulls approve` |
| List issues | `tea issues list` |

### API Scripts

For operations not available in the tea CLI, use the provided API scripts:

- `scripts/gitea-ci-status.sh` - Check CI status via Gitea API
- `scripts/gitea-pr-checks.sh` - Get PR review/approval status

## Limitations

- Requires context network with specific backlog structure
- Gitea-centric (uses `tea` CLI for PR operations)
- Single-task focus (parallel task work not orchestrated)
- Manual CI verification may be needed (Gitea uses external CI)
- Some features depend on Gitea version and configuration
