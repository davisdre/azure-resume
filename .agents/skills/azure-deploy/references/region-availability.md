# Azure Region Availability Reference

## How to Use

1. Check if your architecture includes any **limited availability** services below
2. If yes → refer to the table or use the MCP tool for that service to list supported regions with sufficient quota, and only offer regions that support ALL services
3. If all services are "available everywhere" → offer common regions

## MCP Tools Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `mcp_azure_mcp_quota` | Check Azure region availability and quota by setting `command` to `quota_usage_check` or `quota_region_availability_list` |

---

## Services with LIMITED Region Availability

### Azure Static Web Apps (SWA)

⚠️ **NOT available in many common regions**

| ✅ Available | ❌ NOT Available (will FAIL) |
|-------------|------------------------------|
| `westus2` | `eastus` |
| `centralus` | `northeurope` |
| `eastus2` | `southeastasia` |
| `westeurope` | `uksouth` |
| `eastasia` | `canadacentral` |
| | `australiaeast` |
| | `westus3` |

---

### Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

It has limited quota in some regions, to get available regions with enough quota, use `mcp_azure_mcp_quota` tool.

---

### Azure Database for PostgreSQL

It has limited quota in some regions, to get available regions with enough quota, use `mcp_azure_mcp_quota` tool.

---

### Azure OpenAI

⚠️ **Very limited — varies by model**

| Region | GPT-4o | GPT-4 | GPT-3.5 | Embeddings |
|--------|:------:|:-----:|:-------:|:----------:|
| `eastus` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `eastus2` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `westus` | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `westus3` | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `southcentralus` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `swedencentral` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `westeurope` | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Services Available in Most Regions

These services are available in all major Azure regions — no special consideration needed:

- **Container Apps**
- **Azure Functions**
- **App Service**
- **Azure SQL Database**
- **Cosmos DB**
- **Key Vault**
- **Storage Account**
- **Service Bus**
- **Event Grid**
- **Application Insights / Log Analytics**

## Common Architecture Patterns

| Pattern | Recommended Regions |
|---------|---------------------|
| SWA only | `westus2`, `centralus`, `eastus2`, `westeurope`, `eastasia` |
| SWA + backend services | `westus2`, `centralus`, `eastus2`, `westeurope`, `eastasia` |
| Container Apps (no SWA) | `eastus`, `eastus2`, `westus2`, `centralus`, `westeurope` |
| With Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o/4/3.5 + embeddings) | `eastus`, `eastus2`, `swedencentral` |
| SWA + Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o/4/3.5 + embeddings) | `eastus2` (only region with full SWA + model overlap) |
